                    <p class="overview">I am currently pursuing Computer Science from IIIT Hyderabad. I did my Schooling from St. Joseph High School, Pune and my Senior Secondary from Suryadatta Junior College. I am very passionate about everything that I pick up and have
                        a die-hard attitude to get it done. I love to take up new challenges and learn new things. I believe that hard work and persistence are the key to success. I want to be part of a team solving problems using cutting edge tools and
                        technology. I am currently pursuing Research in NLP while also focusing on Software Development and Competitive Programming.</p>
                    <p class="overview">Outside of work, I love to read and dance. I am a huge Potterhead. I have learnt Kathak dance for 10 years and I have also learnt a few other dance forms. I also love to watch TV shows and movies. I am a member of the Apex body in
                        my University which is an anti-ragging body and is responsible for mentoring freshers when they enter college. I believe in making a difference in the lives of others. Look around to know more about me!

                    <h1>Dancing</h1>
                    <p>I was introduced to dance at the age of 5 when I started learning the Classical dance form, Kathak. I have learnt Kathak for 10 years and I continue to practice it. I have also picked up some other dance styles like Comtemporary, Hip-Hop
                        and Bollywood.</p>
                    <p>Dance is something that I really cherish and love to do. Dance gives one the freedom to use their whole body to express themselves. I can't stop myself from dancing when I listen to some catchy music or rhythm. It really helps me de-stress
                        and get back to my daily routine with new energy and vigour!</p>

                    <h1>Reading</h1>
                    <p>I am a voracious reader and have read many different books in different genres. I enjoy reading fiction novels and am a huge Potterhead; ask me anything about the Potter World ;P. I am also a fan of the Hunger Games, Divergent, Meluha
                        Triology, and many of Sidney Sheldon's novels. </p>
                    <p>Reading transport you to a totally different world. Books can make your imagination race through different places and different eras while sitting in one place. A good book is better than a best friend and will always be there to life
                        your mood and make your day better!</p>

                    <h1>Painting</h1>
                    <p>Painting is a hobby that I have picked up recently. So I am yet learning my way around it. I usually paint scenaries. And from whatever little I know of it, I am really enjoying it. Theres so much one can do with a canvas and a few
                        color and brushes.</p>
                    <p>Painting is a medium to express yourself without words. You can put down your imagination on a piece of paper for others to see. The creativity that goes behind painting also helps me in being creative with my work!</p>

                    <h1>Music</h1>
                    <p>I spend a lot of time listening to music. You would always find me walking around campus with earphones. While I don't pursue any form of vocal or instrumental music, I love to listen to music of any kind. I mostly listen to Comtemporary
                        music. </p>
                    <p>Art in any form is an expression of the artists' emotions and thoughts. I often find myself connecting different songs to different incidents in my life. An evening spent listening to music, reading a book and some coffee is an evening
                        well spent.</p>

                    <h1>Movies & TV Shows</h1>
                    <p>I love to watch movies and TV shows in my free time. I often binge watch entire shows in one night. I love different thrillers - crime, drama, psychology. I also enjoy the comedy genre. I don't let language stop me from watching a
                        good movie/show and have watched movies and shows in different languages.</p>
                    <p>As a kid, I used to watch Matinee movies with my family every Sunday and thats where my love for movies started. Its really great to see the evolution of cinema over time - there's a difference in stories, backdrops, characters. Movies
                        have played a very important role in keeping people informed about current times.</p>

                    <h1>Travel</h1>
                    <p>I like to travel and explore various places. And the more you travel, you realise that our planet is beautiful place with so many different wonders. Every place is unique and has something to offer to each and every one. You also meet
                        new people, try out different cuisines, learn more about different cultures and ways of life - its all very exciting.</p>
                    <p>One of the things in my bucket list is to go on a solo World Trip to know more about different places, people and cultures as well as spend time with myself. Travelling is a great way to put your thoughts together and discover yourself
                        while discovering new places.</p>
