              <h3>Dance</h3>
              <p>I have been dancing since the age of five when I started learning the classical dance form, kathak. I also know the dance styles of contemporary, hip-hop, bollywood. Dance gives one the freedom to use their whole body to express themselves. Dance allows the innermost emotions to flow.</p>

              <h3>Reading</h3>
              <p>Reading has and will always be my first love. Its a passion I have nurtured since childhood. I love reading fiction especially thrillers and sci-fi. Books transport you to a totally different world. Books can make your imagination race though you are sitting in one place.</p>

              <h3>Music</h3>
              <p>Music is an integral part of my life. Though I neither play any instrument nor sing, I can deeply connect to songs and the meaning that they hold. An evening spent listening to my favourite music is an evening well spent.</p>

              <h3>Travel</h3>
              <p>Travelling is a great way to visit new places as well as connect with oneself. It gives you an opportunity to spend time with family and friends. Someday I want to travel all around the world and see the beautiful places this world has.</p>

              <h3>Movies</h3>
              <p>I'm a huge movie buff. I love watching all kinds of movies especially comedies and action. Movies are a great way to relax as well as while away time (which will never come back). If there's one thing I love, its a great movie along with great company and some popcorn.</p>

              <h3>Sleep</h3>
              <p>Sleeping is my favourite activity. When there's nothing to do (or even when there's a lot to do), sleeping is the best option. Sleeping can refresh your mind and also help one think clearly. Over the years I have developed the uncanny ability to fall asleep within a matter of few seconds and under any circumstance.</p>
